ðŸŒŸ Project Title: Motoshed - Backend
This repository contains the backend for the Motoshed application. This is a RESTful API built with Node.js that powers the server-side logic, including a robust email notification system for user orders and administrative alerts.

Features:
API Endpoints: Provides a set of well-defined API endpoints for handling [e.g., user authentication, service orders, data management, etc.].

Automated Email Notifications: Integrates a mailing system using Nodemailer to automatically send order confirmations to users and new order alerts to the administrator.

Authentication & Authorization: Secure API access is managed using API keys to identify and validate requests from different users and roles (e.g., admin vs. user).

Database Management: Utilizes MongoDB to efficiently store and retrieve all application data.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Email Service: Nodemailer

Tools:

AI (optional): Used to assist in the development of the mailing system.

ðŸ“§ Email System Overview
The email system is designed to provide immediate feedback to users and admins.

When a user places an order for a service, the server makes a call to the email service.

Nodemailer sends a customized email to the user with the order details.

Simultaneously, a separate email is sent to the administrator to notify them of the new order.

After confirming the order the user will also get another confermation email for his order.

The system uses secure API keys to ensure only authorized requests can trigger these notifications.

ðŸ”— Live API Endpoint
The live API is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at:

Note: For security, access to certain endpoints may require a valid API key.
